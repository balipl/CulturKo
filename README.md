# CulturKo

The game written in Unity, which makes the city tour a game. The user can perform special tasks and solve quizzes, in return receiving points and valuable prizes.

## What is it?

It combines the opportunity to learn about culture with the possibility of receiving benefits. Perfectly fills free time. Causes users to visit ads themselves. Teaches in an interesting way and takes people out of the house. In the game you can travel on the actual map of Krakow, visit places and complete tasks for which you get points.

## How it looks?

You can see on the video below:
